# Project Title

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates fundamental error handling mechanisms: `require()` for validating conditions, `assert()` for internal consistency checks, and `revert()` for reverting transactions with custom messages. It allows setting a non-zero value, showcases assertion checks, and handles conditions where inputs fail specified requirements, ensuring robust contract behavior on Ethereum.
## Description

This Solidity smart contract serves as a foundational example of error handling mechanisms crucial for secure and reliable Ethereum smart contract development. 

**Purpose and Functions:**
The contract includes three main functions:
1. `setNum(uint256 _num)`: Ensures `_num` is greater than zero using `require()`, preventing setting the value to invalid or unintended states. This function demonstrates input validation, essential for maintaining contract integrity and preventing undesirable state changes.

2. `assertExample()`: Illustrates the use of `assert()` to enforce internal consistency. It verifies that a condition (`x > y`) holds true during execution. If the assertion fails, it indicates a critical logic error, halting execution to prevent further unintended consequences.

3. `revertExample(uint256 _amount)`: Utilizes `revert()` to handle conditions where `_amount` does not meet specified requirements (e.g., must be greater than 100). This function provides a controlled way to revert transactions with custom error messages, ensuring clarity and predictability in contract interactions.

**Significance:**
These error handling mechanisms are crucial for maintaining contract security and reliability. `require()` guards against invalid inputs, `assert()` ensures internal consistency, and `revert()` provides explicit error handling. Together, they help developers build contracts that are resilient to unexpected conditions, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing trust in decentralized applications (dApps) built on Ethereum. By demonstrating these mechanisms, the contract promotes best practices in Ethereum development, ensuring robustness and safeguarding against potential exploits and unintended behaviors.
